# ML-Linear-Regression
Implementing the linear regression algorithm to make predictions based on data. 
The dataset in this example is student grades.
We want to predict "G3" grade based on other grades, studytime, failures, and absences.
The code goes as follows:
 1. Opens CSV file 
 2. Changes it to a "readable" format
 3. Divides data into training and testing sets
 4. Creates a linear regression model and prints accuracy based on testing set
 5. (Commented part) picks the most accurate model in a certain iteration then saves it into a file.
 6. The model file is reopened and used to predict G3 for a testing dataset
 7. Plotted to visualize relationships (OPTIONAL)
